  <center> <font face="verdana" color="blue"> <br> This was my first scratch project. I made the sprite rotate when the space bar is pressed. If the space bar is not pressed then the sprite will ask if you are there. It was challenging to try to get a feel of using scratch but this was one of my first tasks. </font> <br> <br>

   <center> <font face="verdana" color="blue"> <br>This was me and my partner's Matthew Scratch Project. Our goal was to create a game. We decided to remix a scary maze game. Some of the things that we changed were making the controls from being mouse pointed to being controlled by the arrow keys. We also changed the features of the sprite, background music, and text that pops up in the game. We also made it a lot scarier. </font> <br>

 <center> <font face="verdana" color="blue"> <br>This was me and my partner Erick's code for our visualization for the 3.2.1 Project. We made a pie chart representing the average hours of sleep seniors in high school get. This represented how procrastination affects the health and school performance of students. It seems that high schoolers that are older have more problems with procrastination and sleep.</font> <br>

We altered the Fire Simulation and added new variables which overall change what the simlation does. We added wind,temperature and a plot which reads the rate in which the fire spreads.</font> <br>
