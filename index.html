<font face="Times New Roman" color="white">Hi my name is Jonathan Castro. Some of the things I enjoy doing are playing video games, sports, and eating. Some of my favorite foods are waffles and organic orange juice. I am taking CSP and so far it has been challenging but very informant. I hope to become an engineer someday and be able to do lots of things with code. </font>
